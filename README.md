# Nelson Rules

"Nelson rules are a method in process control of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules, for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first postulated by Walter A. Shewhart in the 1920s. The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an article by Lloyd S Nelson.

The rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_rules)

There are 8 rules in total.  This python module will accept a pandas series object of a time series dataset and create charts and tables relative to the 8 rules.
